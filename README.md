# Echo-LED
This project demonstrates how to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of an object and perform actions based on the measured distance. An LED is used as an indicator to signal when an object is within a specified range (10 inches). The distances are also displayed in both inches and centimeters via the Serial Monitor.

This project is ideal for beginners exploring basic electronics and sensors, and it can be extended to applications like obstacle detection, parking assistance systems, or robotics.
